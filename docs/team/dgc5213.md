## Project: Employee Tracker

The Employee Tracker allows small business owners to keep track of their employees information using a single platform instead of having to deal with multiple data management tools.
Through a simple and intuitive graphical user interface, business owners can record and view their employees' information.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to find the matched records based on the different filter criteria. Finds employee records that have any of the given keywords in their name/role/address/date of birth/phone number.
  * Justification: This feature improves the flexibility of getting the desired result significantly because a user can have the flexibility to execute different filters in find commands and the app should provide a convenient way to return the matched results.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands as it required changes to existing commands, other relevant class and methods. Also, it required to fix the testing issue and add new testing cases so that the program works properly.
