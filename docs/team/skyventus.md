* Community:
  * Our application was developed using a combination of pair-programming and adhoc coding sessions. During each session lasting between an hour to four or more, all group members sat in a meeting session while coding/ implementing their assigned components. If a concern was raised or support was needed, they shared their screen via the meeting session and everyone participated or assisted to clear the obstacle. Using this method we've successfully cleared v1.0 to v3.0 of our project milestones. 
  * Help to resolve some of the bugs in the issue tracker with pair programming.
