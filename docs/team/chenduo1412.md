## Project: Employee Tracker

The Employee Tracker allows small business owners to keep track of their employees information using a single platform instead of having to deal with multiple data management tools.
Through a simple and intuitive graphical user interface, business owners can record and view their employees' information.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the stats commands and functions.
  * What it does: allows the user to get the complete stats from all the employee records,so they can review the clear statements of number of employees, highest/lowest salary with the employee's name,average salary, highest/lowest tenure with employee's name.
  * Justification: This feature improves the experience of the user. Through this function, users can have a comprehensive understanding of important information of the employee.
  * Highlights: This function needs to traverse the entire list and calculate the required data. The calculation of tenure is more complicated, by comparing the milliseconds between two dates and converting them into days. At the same time, there are many people with the same salary/tenure, and find the matching names by traversing the list.
