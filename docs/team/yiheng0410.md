* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add/remove s specific tag (Pull requests [\#101](https://github.com/AY2021S2-TIC4002-F18-1/tp2/pull/101))
  * What it does: allows the user to add/remove a specific tag without deleting and overwriting the whole tag list.  
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience significantly because it gives an alternative to user to add or remove a specific because the user won't need to re-type the whole tag list again in order to add/remove a tag.
