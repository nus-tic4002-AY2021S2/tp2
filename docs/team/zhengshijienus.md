## Overview: Addressbook NS Edition (ABNS)

ABNS is a desktop address book application used for managing National Service soldiers' performance. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

It is 

* for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).
* to include more information of the soldier such as rank, group, and performance.
* to manage records as a bulk without the hassle of editing records one by one.

## Summary of Contributions

### Key Features implemented & Enhancements 

|Action|Format, Examples|
|--------|----------|
| assign a person to group | ```assignptg n/<personName> g/<groupName>``` |
| rename a group | ```rename <Index> g/<groupName>``` |

* Assign a person  to a group.(Pull requests [\#29](https://github.com/AY2021S2-TIC4002-F18-3/tp2/pull/29))

  * What it does: allows the user to assign a person to a specific group. 
  * Justification: This feature allows user to assign person to group instead of just creating group. The purpose of using this address book is to assign different people into different group.Thus the software shall provide a such function.
  * Highlights: Assigning is easy but the hard part is how to synchronize with other part accordingly. 

* Added the ability to rename the group name.(Pull requests [\#55](https://github.com/AY2021S2-TIC4002-F18-3/tp2/pull/55))
  * What it does: allows user to rename a specific group name and automatically update all fields related accordingly.
  * Highlights: Same as the last feature, the hard part is how to synchronize with other part accordingly. Synchronizing all info of those people under this renamed group is hard part for me.
