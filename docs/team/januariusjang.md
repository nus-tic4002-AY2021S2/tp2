#### Address book (NS edition)

AddressBook (NS edition) - A desktop app for managing NS personnel, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Address Book (NS Edition) can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-tic4002-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=JanuariusJang&tabRepo=AY2021S2-TIC4002-F18-3%2Ftp2%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)


* **New Feature**: Added the Delete Group feature.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete groups that are not in use.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because it allows users to do housekeeping on unused groups. 
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and extending existing ones
  

* **New Feature**: Added the Delete Group feature when personnel are assigned. It will re-assign personnel to N/A group first before deleting the original group.
    * What it does: Allows the user to delete groups without checking if there are any users in that group.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it saves the user time. Without this feature, the user would need to reassign personnel to the other groups before deleting it again. 
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and extending existing ones.
