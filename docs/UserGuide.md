## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
 
* Date format should be `dd-mm-yyyy`, other date format will not be accepted.
  e.g. `23-02-2021` is a valid date format, `Feb-23-2021` or `02-23-2021` is an invalid date format. 
  
* Date should be a valid calendar date, date out of range will not be accepted.
  e.g. `23-02-2021` is a valid calendar date, `33-02-2021` is an invalid date format. 
  
* NRIC format should be `1 capital letter that start with S, T, F or G,followed by 7 numerical numbers and a capital letter with alphanumeric characters . It should not be blank.`, other NRIC format will not be accepted.
    e.g. `S1234567B` is a valid NRIC format, `s2222b` or `s11111111` is an invalid NRIC format.
