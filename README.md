* **Police Address Book (PAB)** is a desktop app meant for Police Investigation Officers, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* It is designed to help them manage their investigation cases better by reminding them on which people to call, automatically rescheduling follow up calls and assisting in sending case detail emails to colleagues or call notification emails to people in the contact list.
  
* Detailed documentation of this project can be found in the **[Police Address Book Website](https://ay2021s2-tic4002-f18-1.github.io/tp2/)**.
