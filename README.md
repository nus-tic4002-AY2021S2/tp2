* This is a project for TIC4002 students.

* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _PatientBook_) used for managing patient details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `PatientBook Level 3` (`PB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `PatientBook`.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Patient Book Product Website](https://github.com/AY2021S2-TIC4002-F18-4/tp2)**.
